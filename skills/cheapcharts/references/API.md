**API Base URL:** `https://buster.cheapcharts.de/v1/gptapi/`
**All-time-low (ATL) check:** `https://buster.cheapcharts.de/v1/DetailData.php` (unofficial internal endpoint - see [Pitfall #17](PITFALLS.md#17-detaildata-is-unofficial))

> **Common parameters:** Charts, Deals, Prices, and Recommendations share common parameters (`action`, `store`, `country`, `itemType`, `imdbRating`, `rottenTomatoesRating`). Search and Topseller have their own parameter sets (see their sections below).

## Source semantics and adaptive routing

The public endpoints provide evidence; they do not provide the skill's Browse / Inspect / Decide routing or its `applied_scope`. The host agent constructs those from the user's request and conversation context.

| Source | Truthful user-facing label | Do not call it |
|---|---|---|
| Deals | CheapCharts deals / price drops | Charts, recommendations, or an exhaustive catalog |
| Charts | CheapCharts chart rankings | Deals or verified price drops |
| Recommendations | CheapCharts recommendations | Deals; rating filters are unreliable here |
| Topseller | CheapCharts cross-store top sellers | Deals or a cross-store price comparison |
| Search | CheapCharts title search candidates | A resolved title when plausible matches remain |
| DetailData | CheapCharts title detail / tracked price history | An official endpoint or a future-price guarantee |

Resolve factual title questions through Search plus the relevant price/detail evidence. Ambiguous Search candidates require disambiguation when identity would change the answer; a decision can never use evidence confidence to compensate for uncertain identity. Verified rental prices are unsupported, so never substitute a Prices purchase response.

Capability validation precedes fetch, filtering, retry, or widening. Movie Deals quality filters are native; movie-bundles-only and complete-series-only are composable candidate scopes until catalog completeness is verified; rentals, TV genre, and seasons+4K are unsupported or unreliable. Every composable, dropped, or degraded dimension must be visible in the host-produced applied scope.

The host's structured envelope records a complete canonical `applied_scope` with provenance such as `user_set`, `inherited`, `default`, or `dropped_unsupported`, plus any fallback window, substitution, or retry. These are wrapper-contract fields, not fields returned by the upstream endpoints. Existing raw batch `--json` remains a list/`[]`; scoped Browse output is additive through `--scoped-json`, and one-title decision JSON uses `--decide TITLE --json`.

## 1. Search - `Search.php`

Find items by title. Use this FIRST when you only have a title and need the IMDb ID.

**Required:** `action=search`, `query=<title>` (or `searchTerm=<title>` - alias, per vendor's llms.txt)
**Optional:** `store=itunes` (default), `country=us` (default), `itemType=all` (default), `limit=20` (default 20, max 20), `offset=0` (paging offset for results beyond limit)

Returns flat list: `{"status":"success","results":[...items...]}`. Each item includes `imdbId` (if available), `mediaType`, `itemType`, `priceFollowUpItemType`, `store`, `country`, `cheapChartsProductPageUrl`, `title`, `artist`, `releaseDate`, `releaseYear`, `price`, `currentPrice`, `has4K`, `hdrFormat`, `imdbRating`, `rottenTomatoesRating` (see Common Item Fields below). Search currency is store-dependent and may be absent; use the follow-up DetailData/Deals field ([Pitfall #40](PITFALLS.md#40-deals-and-detaildata-carry-currency-search-currency-is-not-reliable)).

## 2. Charts - `Charts.php`

Current CheapCharts chart rankings for movies or TV seasons. Label the result as chart rankings, never as a Deals feed.

**Required:** `action=getCharts`, `store`, `country`, `itemType` (buymovies or seasons)
**Optional:** `genre=All`, `quality=hd4k`, `limit`, `imdbRating` (min), `rottenTomatoesRating` (min), `releaseYear` (e.g. `2025-2025`)

Returns: `{"status":"success","results":{"buymovies":[...]}}`. Items include `rank` field.

## 3. Deals - `Deals.php`

Current deals and price drops. Best for bargain hunting.

**Required:** `action=getDeals`, `store`, `country`, `itemType` (buymovies or seasons)
**Optional:** `genre=All`, `quality=hd4k` (`quality=4k` is verified for `buymovies` only; seasons+4k errors), `sort=latestPricechange`, `maxPrice`, `releaseYear` (format: `2020-2025` - single year like `2026-2026` works too; default: all years), `limit`, `imdbRating` (min rating 0-10, default 0 = no filter, e.g. `imdbRating=7`), `rottenTomatoesRating` (min score 0-100, default 0 = no filter, e.g. `rottenTomatoesRating=80`), `has4K=1` (DOES NOT WORK - ignored; use `quality=4k` for new movie Deals requests, or filter an already-fetched response client-side, [Pitfall #16](PITFALLS.md#16-has4k1-filter-does-not-work-on-dealscharts))

**Sort options:** `latestPricechange` (default), `price`, `greatestSavings`, `greatestPercentageSavings`, `popularity`, `alphabetical`, `releaseDate` (ascending only - see [Pitfall #11](PITFALLS.md#11-sortreleasedate-is-ascending-only))

**Date filter:** `releaseYear=YYYY-YYYY` accepts both single-year (`2026-2026`) and ranges (`2024-2026`). Works on Deals and Charts endpoints. NOT supported on Recommendations, Prices, or Search.

Returns: `{"status":"success","results":{"buymovies":[...]}}`. Items include `price`, `priceBefore`, `imdbRating`, `rottenTomatoesRating`.

## 4. Prices - `Prices.php`

Look up current prices for specific titles by IMDb ID.

**Required:** `action=getPrices`, `store`, `country`, `itemType=buymovies`, `imdbIDs` (comma-separated, e.g. `tt0468569,tt2911666`)

Note: llms.txt Common Parameters list `seasons` as valid for Prices, but the Prices-specific param table and empirical testing confirm only `buymovies` works - see [Pitfall #7](PITFALLS.md#7-seasonsbundles-lack-imdb-ids---prices-api-explicitly-rejects-seasons). Do not use `rentalmovies`: Prices ignores it and returns purchase data under `results.buymovies` ([Pitfall #38](PITFALLS.md#38-rentalmovies-is-not-a-supported-public-api-price-mode)).

Returns: `{"status":"success","results":{"buymovies":[...]}}`. Same item shape as Deals.

## 5. Recommendations - `Recommendations.php`

CheapCharts recommendations, filtered by genre and quality. Label the result as recommendations, never as deals.

**Required:** `action=getRecommendations`, `store`, `country`, `itemType` (buymovies or seasons)
**Optional:** `genre=All`, `quality=hd4k`, `limit`, `imdbRating`, `rottenTomatoesRating`

**Note:** llms.txt lists `imdbRating`/`rottenTomatoesRating` as supported here, but empirical testing shows they are silently ignored on Recommendations ([Pitfall #23](PITFALLS.md#23-imdbrating-and-rottentomatoesrating-filters-work-on-dealscharts-but-not-on-recommendations)). Use Deals with `sort=greatestSavings` + rating filters instead.

Returns: `{"status":"success","results":{"buymovies":[...]}}`. Items may include `description` field.

## 6. Topseller - `Topseller.php`

CheapCharts top sellers across multiple stores. Label the result as cross-store top sellers, never as deals or a cross-store price comparison. Does NOT require `itemType`, `imdbRating`, or `rottenTomatoesRating` (unlike other endpoints).

**Required:** `action=getTopsellerForStartpage`, `country`, `store` (comma-separated, e.g. `itunes,amazon,vudu,googlePlay`)
**Optional:** `maxItemCount=5` (default 5, per store per category)

Returns: `{"status":"success","results":{"itunes":{"movies":[...],"seasons":[...]},"amazon":{...}}}`. Grouped by store, then by movies/seasons. Field availability varies by store - `has4K`, `hasAtmos`, `hdrFormat`, `isMovieBundle` only appear for iTunes items ([Pitfall #3](PITFALLS.md#3-expecting-all-fields-on-all-stores)).

## 7. DetailData (Internal) - `DetailData.php`

**Not in the official gptapi docs.** Discovered by inspecting the CheapCharts website's network calls. Returns full item details including current prices, complete price history, and child seasons (for bundles). Works for both movies and seasons. **This is the reliable way to get season/bundle prices without a browser.**

**Required:** `store`, `country`, `itemType` (`movies` or `seasons` - NOT `buymovies`, [Pitfall #13](PITFALLS.md#13-detaildata-itemtype-is-movies-or-seasons---not-buymovies)), `idInStore` (the iTunes store ID from Search results)

Returns: `{"results":{"seasons":{...}}}` (key matches the `itemType` you passed).

**Key fields (movies and seasons):**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `priceSd` / `priceHd` | Current SD/HD price |
| `priceSdBefore` / `priceHdBefore` | Previous price before last change |
| `priceSdLastChangeDate` / `priceHdLastChangeDate` | Date of last price change |
| `priceSdEvolution` / `priceHdEvolution` | Full price history as `date:[+/-]price~...` string, newest first. Each value is the ABSOLUTE price effective from that date; the sign is only the change direction. See "Parsing priceHdEvolution" below. Absent on some titles/tiers (e.g. SD-only items have no HD evolution). |
| `priceSdIsLowest` / `priceHdIsLowest` | `1` if current SD/HD price equals the all-time low across CheapCharts' tracked history for this title, else `0`. **This is the canonical ATL check - use it instead of parsing `priceHdEvolution`.** |
| `priceSdIsBest` / `priceHdIsBest` | `1` if current SD/HD price equals the best (lowest) price within the current sale window (i.e. current ongoing sale's floor), else `0`. Distinct from `IsLowest` - `IsBest=1, IsLowest=0` means "lowest of THIS sale but a previous sale went lower." |
| `priceSdDropIndicator` / `priceHdDropIndicator` | `1` if price rose at last change, `-1` if it dropped, `0` if unchanged. Useful for filtering "real drops" without comparing to `priceBefore`. |
| `isBundle` / `isSeasonBundle` | Whether this is a season bundle |
| `isSeasonComplete` | Whether all seasons are included |
| `childSeasonsCount` | Number of child seasons in the bundle. **May be null even on genuine complete-series bundles** (verified 2026-07-02: Tom & Jerry Kids Show Complete Series returns `isSeasonBundle=1` but `childSeasonsCount=null`) |
| `bundleSavings` / `bundleSavingsHd` | Savings vs buying seasons individually at regular price. **May be null on bundles** - treat as optional |
| `saveOpportunity` / `saveOpportunityHd` | Same as bundleSavings |
| `episodeCount` | Total episodes |
| `advisoryRating` | Content rating (e.g. TV-14) |
| `summary` | Full synopsis |
| `seasonFamily` | Array of child seasons, each with `idInStore`, `title`, `priceSd`, `priceHd`, `priceSdEvolution`, `priceHdEvolution`, `cheapChartsProductPageUrl`. **May be empty even on complete-series bundles** - don't rely on it for child-season pricing |
| `productPageUrl` | Direct Apple TV / iTunes store URL |
| `iTunesUrl` | iTunes URL |
| `imageSmallUrl` / `imageMediumUrl` / `imageLargeUrl` | Cover art URLs |
| `appleTvId` | Apple TV internal ID |

**Parsing `priceHdEvolution`:** Split on `~`, each segment is `YYYY-MM-DD:[+|-]price`, newest first. **Each value is the absolute price in effect from that date** - `+` means the price rose to that value, `-` means it dropped to it, and the rightmost (earliest) segment carries no sign because it's the initial tracked price. Real example (Bernie, verified live 2026-07-02):

```
2026-06-23:-4.99~2026-05-06:+12.99~2026-05-01:-5.99~2026-04-14:+12.99~2026-04-10:-4.99~2026-03-20:+12.99~2026-03-13:-8.99~2026-02-17:12.99
```

reads oldest-to-newest: listed at $12.99 (2026-02-17), dropped to $8.99, back to $12.99, dropped to $4.99, back to $12.99, dropped to $5.99, back to $12.99, dropped to $4.99 (current). The values are NEVER deltas - summing them produces garbage ([Pitfall #26](PITFALLS.md#26-pricehdevolution--pricesdevolution-values-are-absolute-prices-not-deltas)). Validation invariant: the newest segment equals the current `priceHd`/`priceSd` (the weekly CI canary checks this). For "is it at ATL" questions, prefer the `IsLowest` flags; for history timelines, use `python scripts/deals.py --title "<name>" --history`, which parses this format.

## Enum Values

### Store

| Value | Countries Supported |
|---|---|
| `itunes` | us, de, gb, fr, au, ca, at, ch, es, pt, ru, jp, tr, pl, in, cn |
| `amazon` | us, de |
| `vudu` | us |
| `googlePlay` | us |

**Default to `itunes`** if user doesn't specify a store - it has the broadest country support.

### ItemType

| Value | Meaning | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `buymovies` | Movies (purchase prices) | Charts, Deals, Prices, Recommendations |
| `rentalmovies` | Unsupported rental-price request value | Recognized by `deals.py` only for a clear exit-2 capability error ([#38](PITFALLS.md#38-rentalmovies-is-not-a-supported-public-api-price-mode)) |
| `seasons` | TV show seasons | Charts, Deals, Recommendations, DetailData |
| `movies` | Movies (metadata in Search; price detail in DetailData) | Search, DetailData |
| `all` | All media types (movies, seasons, ebooks, audiobooks, albums) | Search only |

**Rental limitation (verified 2026-07-17):** the public API does not expose a verified rental-price workflow. Deals and Charts reject `itemType=rentalmovies`; Prices accepts it syntactically but silently returns purchase data under `results.buymovies`. Search may emit `priceFollowUpItemType=rentalmovies`, but do not pass that value to Prices or present the result as a rental price. See [Pitfall #38](PITFALLS.md#38-rentalmovies-is-not-a-supported-public-api-price-mode).

### Genre

**Movies (`itemType=buymovies`)** - these values actually filter (tested 2026-06-21):

`All` (no filter), `ActionAdventure`, `Comedy`, `Docus` (iTunes only), `Drama`, `MadeForTV`, `Horror`, `Classical`, `Romance`, `Independent`, `KidsFamily`, `MusicDocumentation`, `SciFiFantasy`, `Sport`, `Thriller`, `Western`, `Anime`, `Musicals`

Unknown values silently fall back to "All" - they do NOT error ([Pitfall #22](PITFALLS.md#22-genre-filter-silently-falls-back-to-all-for-unknown-values-on-buymovies)). Not all genres are available for all stores - non-iTunes stores may silently ignore unsupported genre values.

**TV Seasons (`itemType=seasons`)** - the `genre` parameter is broken on Deals, Charts, and Recommendations ([Pitfall #21](PITFALLS.md#21-genre-filter-is-broken-for-seasons-on-deals-charts-and-recommendations)). Omit it and filter by title client-side.

### Quality

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `hd4k` | HD and 4K (default) |
| `hd` | HD-capable (4K titles may also appear) |
| `sd` | SD tier (titles may also offer HD) |
| `4k` | 4K only |
| `sdOnly` | SD only (strict) |

Live verification on 2026-07-17 confirmed these values for `buymovies` Deals ([Pitfall #39](PITFALLS.md#39-quality-filters-work-on-buymovies-deals-use-them-instead-of-has4k1)). Seasons support is narrower: omitted/default, `hd`, `sd`, and `sdOnly` succeed, but `quality=4k` errors. In `deals.py`, `sd` and `sdOnly` select DetailData's SD price, prior price, change date, and selected-tier ATL result. `hd4k`, `hd`, and movie `4k` prefer HD fields and fall back to SD only when HD is unavailable. JSON exposes factual `is_atl_hd` and `is_atl_sd` flags plus `selected_tier` and selected-tier `is_atl`.

## Common Item Fields

| Field | Always Present | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | yes | Movie or TV season title |
